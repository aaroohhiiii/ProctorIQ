Subject: Urgent need for road safety measures

Dear Sir,

Through your newspaper, I want to highlight the alarming increase in road accidents in our city and the urgent need for comprehensive safety measures.

Daily statistics show rising casualties due to reckless driving, poor road conditions, and inadequate traffic management. Major accident-prone areas lack proper signage and speed breakers.

Immediate measures needed include: strict enforcement of traffic rules, installation of CCTV cameras at major intersections, mandatory driver education programs, and regular vehicle fitness checks.

Citizens must also take responsibility by following traffic rules, using helmets and seat belts, and avoiding mobile phones while driving. Schools should include road safety in their curriculum.

Only collective effort from authorities and citizens can reduce this growing menace and make our roads safer.

Yours sincerely,
Amit Sharma
