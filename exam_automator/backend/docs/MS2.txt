II  It illustrates how moments are fleeting and unnoticed, lost amid the distractions of 
digital interactions / it illustrates how easily significant moments can drift away 
when overshadowed by the focus on technology  
[language / expression may vary but the idea should remain relevant]

Yes it does - develop a hunch / mind is constantly alert (any one) 1 
VII  The phrase refers to the natural, meaningful, and often quieter moments that make 
up human existence and relationships—those that occur away from the digital 
chaos. The writer draws our attention towards the genuine life experiences, such 
as face-to-face conversations, quiet contemplation, enjoying nature, and real-world 
interactions, that are overlooked or drowned out by the constant noise of digital 
activity.  
[language / expression may vary but the idea should remain relevant]

X They are – (2 points to be elaborated for either) 
Benefits: Survey outcomes can offer a detailed understanding of the specific needs 
and preferences of various demographic groups, which can enhance the 
effectiveness of health interventions by making them more targeted and relevant. 
Additionally, using these data-driven insights can foster a sense of collaboration 
among stakeholders, promoting a unified approach towards health and 
sustainability. 
 
Challenges: Relying on survey outcomes may present challenges such as the risk 
of biases in the data collection process, which can twist results and lead to 
ineffective interventions. There's also the issue of survey fatigue among 
participants, potentially reducing engagement and the accuracy of the data 
gathered. Moreover, translating survey findings into practical interventions requires 
resources and continuous stakeholder commitment, which might not always be 
feasible.

2.  Answer the following questions, based on given passage. 
 
10 
I 
 
… how busy daily routines influence people to opt for quick and convenient eating 
options, often at the expense of nutritional value 
 
1 
II  
 
A. Primary purpose 1 
III  The TWO points are – 
 
a) Health focus, as fruits are widely recognised for their health benefits, and this 
aligns with the study’s goal to analyse snacking habits and their implications 
for health (making fresh fruits a relevant choice for understanding healthy 
snacking behaviours). 
b) Comparative analysis, as the study aims to compare the health implications of 
seasonal fruits versus packaged snacks. Including fresh fruits allows 
researchers to directly evaluate preferences between natural, healthier choices 
and processed, potentially less healthy alternatives. 
 
2 
IV   
 
Influence – sentence 1 ; Motivation – sentence 2 1 
V 
 
D. Seema - teenager (taste and convenience) ; Mohan - elderly(health, digestive 
ease)  ; Arindam -young adult (health and convenience ) 
 
1 
VI  
 
Due to their increased health needs and focus on foods that are easier to digest 
and nutritionally beneficial. 
 
1 
VII  
 
Targeted interventions can effectively address specific health needs by focusing 
on the unique factors influencing each demographic's snacking choices. For 
example, educational campaigns for parents can foster early healthy eating habits 
in children, while initiatives for teenagers can reduce the impact of advertising and 
peer pressure, promoting wiser food choices. Also, ensuring that middle-aged and 
older adults have access to fresh produce supports ongoing health maintenance, 
directly contributing to overall improved health outcomes across the lifespan.

10 
I  An instance of hope or resilience – Saheb’s continued search in the garbage, 
driven by the occasional discovery of a rupee or a ten-rupee note, symbolises his 
hope and resilience against the overwhelming odds of his harsh life. 
This reflects the theme of enduring hope amidst poverty and destitution - the 
human spirit’s capacity to dream and hope, even in the terribly dire circumstances -- suggesting that the desire for a better life can exist independent of one's current 
state of poverty 
 
2 
II  (Any one)  
 The image of her aging mother -  ‘pale as a late winter’s moon,’  -- conveys the 
fragility and the inevitability of aging -- highlights the physical changes brought 
by time  and evokes a sense of gentle, serene decline rather than abrupt decay 
 The image with the vivid, lively description of young trees sprinting and merry 
children spilling out of their homes --- contrasts sharply with her mother's 
stillness and silence --- enhances the sense of her mother's isolation in her old 
age / the relentless passage of time that spares no one -- life’s transient nature 
 
2 
III  Represents -- the tension between local traditions and foreign occupation  2 
The church clock -- symbol of local, everyday life and continuity --- in stark 
opposition to the Prussian trumpets, which symbolise disruption, military power, 
and the enforcement of foreign rule  
Highlights the theme of loss and the struggle to preserve one's cultural heritage 
against overwhelming odds 
 
IV  The author’s writing style - often blends a conversational tone with introspective 
moments -- deeply affects the reader's engagement and understanding of the 
narrative.  
Use of direct dialogues interspersed with reflective commentary – this approach 
not only makes the interactions more dynamic and engaging but enhances the 
reader’s insight into the complexities of personalities and themes being explored 
 
2 
V Dual –  
 The tendency towards greed and deceit - society, driven by wealth and gain, 
ensnares individuals, reducing their existence to a constant struggle to 
escape from materialistic enticements 
 The potential for redemption through empathy and kindness –kindness and 
trust by the ironmaster’s daughter, Edla, inspires the peddlar to reclaim his 
essential humanity and escape the identity of a thief - signified by his 
decision to return the stolen money and leaving a note explaining his 
thoughts about the world being a rattrap  
 
2 
VI  Largely due to the leadership and advocacy provided by Mahatma Gandhi -- his 
involvement brought national attention to their plight --highlighted the importance 
of civil rights and nonviolent resistance

immediate victory -- inspired a broader movement for social and economic justice 
across India

11.  Answer any two of the following three questions in 40 50 words each : 
 
4 
I  The significance of the toy tiger lies in its stark contrast to the dangerous live tigers 
the Maharaja had been hunting throughout his life.  
Its role in his death brings up the themes of irony and fate central to the story.  
It illustrates -- despite human efforts to control or escape destiny, it can manifest in 
the most unexpected and trivial forms.  
The toy tiger symbolises -- the ultimate futility of the Maharaja’s efforts -- points to 
the folly of those who believe they can master fate through power or violence 
 
2 
II  The literal journey involves Charley, discovering a supposed 'third level' at the 
Grand Central Station--a portal to the year 1894.  The metaphorical journey-
Charley's inner longing for a simpler, more reassuring past—a common human 
desire to retreat to a time perceived as better or less complicated.  
The significance - their portrayal of the universal quest for happiness and fulfillment -- together, these journeys explore themes of escapism, the subjective nature of 
reality, and the deep-seated human need for connection and comfort in familiar but 
idealised, settings. 
 
2 
III 
 
Derry is of the pessimistic view whereas Mr. Lamb is of the optimistic view point. 
Both are disabled but still view life from different perspectives. 
2 
Both protagonists challenges with disfigurement are depicted with a stark realism 
that leans towards pessimism, yet interactions that offer genuine connection hint 
at underlying optimism -- suggest the possibility of emotional survival despite 
physical and social barriers 
 
12.  Answer ANY ONE of the following two questions, in about 120-150 words  5 
A. 
‘A Roadside Stand’ focuses on the economic disparities between rural and urban areas, and  
‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’ delves into the gender-based inequalities within marriage and society.

 Depicts the struggles of rural individuals 
facing economic inequality.

economic disparities, leading to feelings of frustration and helplessness. 
 Aunt Jennifer's Tigers – Aunt experiences oppression and suppression within her marriage 
 Both sets of bearers face the psychological and emotional toll of their respective 
inequalities, resulting in a longing for freedom and empowerment. 
 Despite their challenges, the bearers in both poems demonstrate a desire to assert 
themselves through small acts of defiance or dreams of liberation.

13.  Answer any one of the following two questions, in about 120-150 words 5 
A 
 Incorporation of Traditions: 
 Religion - how religious beliefs influence character actions and decisions.  
For example, Sadao's internal conflict may be influenced by his moral beliefs shaped by 
religious teachings. 
 Family Bonds - how relationships in the family impact character interactions and 
motivations.  
For example, Hana's concern for the safety of her family and the potential repercussions 
of harbouring an enemy soldier could drive her actions. 
 Patriotism - how national loyalty and patriotism create tension and conflict in the 
story.  
For example, Sadao's duty as a citizen and as a doctor may conflict with his compassion 
towards the wounded soldier, highlighting the complexities of wartime allegiances. 
 
 Narrative Techniques: 
 Setting - how the wartime setting amplifies the moral dilemmas faced by the 
characters.  
     The backdrop of war intensifies the stakes and adds urgency to their decisions. 
 Motivation - how cultural influences shape character motivations and drive the plot 
forward.  
  The characters' actions may be guided by deeply ingrained cultural values and beliefs. 
 Sources of Conflict - the key conflicts stemming from cultural differences, 
expectations, and wartime circumstances.  
These conflicts drive the narrative forward and heighten the tension. 
 Pacing - how the pacing of the story reflects the characters' internal struggles and 
external conflicts.  
 The pacing may fluctuate to convey moments of tension, reflection, and resolution. 
 
 
B.  
  (Any two narrative techniques)  
    [The examples may be references and not direct quotes] 
 
a) First-Person Narrative: 
 Technique - The story is narrated from the first-person perspective of Charley, which 
creates an intimate and personal recounting of his experiences and thoughts. 
 Effect - This technique allows readers to directly engage with Charley’s desires and 
fears, making his longing for escape and the nostalgia for a simpler past more 
tangible. 
 Textual Evidence - Charley states, “But that’s the reason, he said, and my friends 
all agreed. Everything points to it, they claimed. My stamp collecting, for example; 
that’s a ‘temporary refuge from reality.’”  
This personal reflection shares his internal justifications and how others perceive his 
escapism. 
 
b) Detailed Descriptive Language: 
 Technique - The use of vivid and specific descriptions of settings and times, 
particularly Charley’s descriptions of the third level of Grand Central Station. 
 Effect on Themes - These descriptions not only build a believable world but also 
vividly paint the past, stressing the theme of nostalgia and the allure of escapism 
to a seemingly better and simpler time. 
 
 Textual Evidence - “Then I saw why; they were open-flame gaslights.” and 
“everyone in the station was dressed like eighteen-ninety-something; I never saw 
so many beards, sideburns, and fancy mustaches in my life.”  
These details highlight the historical setting Charley escapes to, filled with elements from 
the past. 
 
c) Symbolism: 
 Technique - The story uses the ‘third level’ as a symbol, representing not just a 
physical place but a mental escape into another time. 
 
 Effect on Themes - The third level serves as a metaphor for the psychological 
refuge one seeks from the modern world’s anxieties, underlining the theme of 
escapism. 
 Textual Evidence – Charley mentions, “Grand Central has been an exit, a way of 
escape—maybe that’s how the tunnel I got into.”  
This line explicitly connects the physical space of the third level to the concept of escaping 
reality. 
 
d) Contrast and Irony: 
 Technique - The stark contrast between Charley’s mundane, modern life and his 
adventures on the third level introduces a layer of irony. 
 Effect on Themes - This contrast enhances the nostalgic appeal of the third level 
while ironically pointing out the impracticalities of such escapism. 
 Textual Evidence - “The clerk figured the fare—he glanced at my fancy hatband, 
but he figured the fare—and I had enough for two coach tickets, one way. But when 
I counted out the money and looked up, the clerk was staring at me.”  
This shows how out of place modern elements are in the past, highlighting the nostalgic 
yet challenging nature of his escape.
