Read the following passage carefully:        
(22 marks) 
12 
(1) In a room filled with people, each face illuminated by the soft glow of their smartphones, 
moments drift away like autumn leaves in the wind. The constant hum of notifications fills the 
air, punctuating conversations like an incessant drumbeat. Every vibration or ping sends 
fingers flying to screens, a response ingrained by years of digital conditioning. The once
reliable tick-tock of analog timepieces has been overshadowed by the constant flicker of 
notifications on the wrist watch, blurring the boundaries between the virtual and the real. 
(2) Anxiety gnaws at the edges of consciousness when the phone is out of reach, a phantom 
limb syndrome that leaves us feeling incomplete without our digital appendage. The fear of 
missing out permeates every moment spent away from the screen, driving us to constantly 
check for updates and notifications. 
(3) Thumbs move with the speed and precision of skillful pianists, tapping out messages and 
scrolling through feeds with practiced ease. Yet amidst the flurry of activity, the true rhythm 
of life remains unheard, drowned out by the dissonance of digital noise. The weight of 
constant connectivity forms a hunch upon our shoulders, a physical manifestation of the 
burden we carry in an age of information overload. Our minds are perpetually on high alert, 
scanning for the next wave of excitement that comes with each like, share, or comment. 
(4) And yet, for all our efforts to stay connected, we find ourselves increasingly isolated in a sea 
of digital faces. Genuine connections are fleeting, drowned out by the constant clamour for 
attention. In the pursuit of digital validation, we sacrifice the wealth of lived experience, 
trading meaningful moments for fleeting glimpses of connection. The true essence of life lies 
not in the pixels on a screen, but in the depth of human connection and the richness of 
shared experiences 
1 
(5) As we navigate this brave new world of constant connectivity, let us not forget the value of 
presence and the beauty of being fully engaged in the moments that matter most. For in the 
end, it is not the number of likes or followers that defines us, but the depth of our 
connections and the richness of our experiences that truly matter.

Read the following carefully. 
(1) Introduction:  
2 
10 
In the hasty lifestyle of today’s world, the choice of snacks can greatly impact one's health 
and well-being. This case study aims to analyse the preference for seasonal fruits compared 
to packaged snacks among different age groups and the implications for overall health. 
(2) Methodology: 
A survey was conducted among individuals across various age groups, ranging from 
children to seniors, to determine their snacking preferences. Participants were asked to 
indicate their preferred snack choices and provide reasons for their preferences. The data 
was then analysed to identify trends and patterns among different age demographics. 
(3) Survey Examination:  
The survey encompassed a comprehensive examination of snacking habits, including not 
only preferred snack choices but also delving into the underlying motivations and influences 
guiding these choices. Beyond mere preference, participants were encouraged to articulate 
the reasons behind their selections, providing invaluable insights into the multifaceted nature 
of snacking behavior. 
(4) Results: 
The survey results revealed interesting insights into snacking preferences among different 
age groups: 
Age-group 
% 
Preferred 
snack 
Reasons for preference 
Children 
Teenagers 
77 Seasonal fruits Taste, Health benefits, Parental guidance 
65 Packaged 
snacks 
Convenience, Taste, Peer influence 
Young 
adults 
52 seasonal  fruits 
and packaged 
snacks 
Transitional lifestyle(college, beginning careers, and 
establishing independence), Health consciousness, 
Convenience 
Middle-aged 83 Seasonal fruits Freshness, Nutrition, Health consciousness 
90 Seasonal fruits Health benefits, Digestive ease 
Elderly 
(5) Implications for Interventions: 
By discerning the diverse preferences among different age groups, policymakers and health 
practitioners can tailor interventions to address specific demographic needs. For instance, 
targeting educational campaigns towards parents could empower them to instill healthy 
eating habits in their children from an early age. Concurrently, efforts to mitigate the 
3 
influence of advertising and peer pressure on teenagers could involve regulatory measures 
and educational initiatives aimed at promoting critical thinking and informed decision-making. 
Furthermore, the prominence of seasonal fruits as a preferred snack choice among middle
aged adults and senior’s points towards the importance of promoting access to fresh 
produce and nutritional education across all age demographics. 
(6) Conclusion:  
The survey outcomes serve as a roadmap for designing targeted interventions that not only 
cater to diverse demographic needs but also nurture a culture of health and well-being. By 
harnessing the insights gleaned from this study, stakeholders can collaboratively work 
towards building healthier communities and promoting sustainable practices for generations 
to come.

from and where we could possibly be heading. It’s to understand the significance of 
Cordilleran folds and pre-Cambrian granite shields; ozone and carbon; evolution and 
extinction. When you think about all that can happen in a million years, it can get pretty 
mind-boggling. Imagine: India pushing northwards, jamming against Asia to buckle its crust 
and form the Himalayas; South America drifting off to join North America, opening up the 
Drake Passage to create a cold circumpolar current, keeping Antarctica frigid, desolate, 
and at the bottom of the world.

B. And survival in Seemapuri means rag-picking. Through the years, it has acquired the 
proportions of a fine art. Garbage to them is gold. It is their daily bread, a roof over their 
heads, even if it is a leaking roof. But for a child it is even more “I sometimes find a rupee, 
even a ten-rupee note,” Saheb says, his eyes lighting up. When you can find a silver coin in 
a heap of garbage, you don’t stop scrounging, for there is hope of finding more. It seems 
that for children, garbage has a meaning different from what it means to their parents. For 
the children it is wrapped in wonder, for the elders it is a means of survival.               
                                                                   (Lost Spring – Stories of Stolen Childhood)

C. Rag-picking is a temporary activity that does not significantly impact the community.
