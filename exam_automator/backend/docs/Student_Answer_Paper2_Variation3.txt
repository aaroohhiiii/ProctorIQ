Subject: Urgent call for water conservation measures

Dear Sir,

Through your esteemed newspaper, I wish to highlight the critical water crisis facing our nation and the urgent need for comprehensive conservation measures.

With rapidly depleting groundwater levels and erratic rainfall patterns, cities across India are experiencing severe water shortages. The situation demands immediate action from both government and citizens.

Effective measures include mandatory rainwater harvesting, installation of water-efficient fixtures, and strict monitoring of industrial water usage. Educational campaigns in schools and communities can create awareness about conservation techniques.

Government policies should incentivize water-saving technologies and penalize wastage. Citizens must adopt responsible consumption habits, repair leakages promptly, and reuse greywater for non-potable purposes.

Water conservation is not merely an environmental concern but a survival necessity. Every drop saved today ensures water security for future generations.

I urge immediate and collective action on this pressing issue.

Yours sincerely,
Ravi Kumar

Option A: A Thing of Beauty

I. What does Keats mean by "a thing of beauty is a joy forever"?

[CORRECT: Sophisticated understanding of the concept]

II. How does beauty help us overcome the sadness and suffering of life?

[CORRECT: Excellent analysis of beauty's therapeutic role]

III. What are the things of beauty mentioned in the poem?

[CORRECT: Comprehensive identification with categorization]

IV. How do beautiful things provide us with quiet breathing and sweet dreams?
Answer: Beautiful things create a sense of inner peace and tranquility that calms our restless minds. This peaceful state allows for deeper, more restful breathing and promotes sweet dreams by filling our consciousness with positive, harmonious thoughts rather than anxieties and worries.
[CORRECT: Thoughtful explanation of the psychological impact]

V. What is the significance of the phrase "immortal drink" in the poem?

VI. How does the poet contrast beauty with the ugliness of the world?
