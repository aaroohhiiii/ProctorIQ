Dear Sir,

Through your newspaper, I want to highlight the critical issue of water scarcity in our city. With depleting groundwater levels and irregular rainfall, we face a severe crisis.

Citizens must adopt rainwater harvesting, fix leaking taps, and use water-efficient appliances. Government should implement strict policies and create awareness campaigns.
