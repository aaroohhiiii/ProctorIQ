Arthur lay in his cabin, still trying to piece together the events of the last few hours. He had watched 
his home planet of Earth be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, been saved by his 
friend Ford, and then whisked away on a ship that was powered by an "infinite improbability drive." 
It was all too much for him. 
Just then, Ford stuck his head around the door. 
"Hey, Earthman," he said, "come and have a look at this." 
Arthur stumbled after him down a corridor and into the ship's control room. He gazed in amazement 
at the banks of controls and flashing lights. In the center of the room was a large console covered in 
buttons and switches, and in the middle of the console was a small, white mouse.

"What's that?" asked Arthur. 
"That's the ship's computer," said Ford. 
Arthur stared at the mouse. "That's a computer?" he said. 
"Yup," said Ford. "Five-dimensional, biologically-based, super intelligent, and in the form of a white 
lab mouse. Pretty neat, huh?" 
"I don't know," said Arthur. "I don't think I really understand anything anymore. Why is a mouse the 
ship's computer?" 
"It's a long story," said Ford. "But the short version is that the mice built the Earth as a giant computer 
to figure out the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Then they ran out of money 
and had to destroy it to make way for a hyperspace bypass. So now they're using the Heart of Gold to 
finish the calculation." 
Arthur was about to say something, but at that moment the ship's intercom crackled to life. 
"Good evening, Heart of Gold," said a smooth, computerized voice. "This is Eddie, your shipboard 
computer. I'm feeling a bit depressed today. Would you like me to sing you a song?" 
"Oh, not again," groaned Ford. 
"Eddie, would you mind shutting up?" said Arthur. 
Arthur sighed and leaned back against the console, trying to make sense of everything. But as he 
closed his eyes, he heard a voice inside his head. 
"Hello?" it said. 
Arthur jumped, startled. "Who's there?" he said. 
"It's me," said the voice. "Marvin."

Page 2 of 11 
 
"Marvin?" said Arthur. "Who's Marvin?" 
"The Paranoid Android," said the voice.

Arthur looked around, but he didn't see anyone. "Where are you?" he said. 
"I'm down here," said the voice. 
Arthur looked down and saw a small, metal figure shuffling across the floor. It was about three feet 
tall, with a round head and a body that looked like it had been cobbled together from spare parts. Its 
eyes were a dull red, and its voice was a monotone. 
"I've been waiting for someone to talk to me for over two million years," said Marvin.

2.  Read the following text. 10 m  
 
(1) In recent years, there has been a surge in both group and solo travel among young adults in India. A 
survey conducted among young adults aged 18-25 aimed to explore the reasons behind their travel 
preferences and recorded the percentage variation for 10 common points that influence travel 
choices. 
 
(2) 
Among those who prefer solo travel, the most common reason cited was the desire for independence 
and freedom (58%), followed closely by the opportunity for introspection and self-discovery (52%). 
Additionally, solo travellers appreciated the ability to customize their itinerary to their preferences 
(44%) and the chance to meet new people on their own terms (36%). 
 
(3) 
On the other hand, those who prefer group travel often cited the desire for socializing and making 
new friends (61%) as their primary reason. Group travel also provided a sense of security and safety 
in unfamiliar places (52%) and allowed for shared experiences and memories with others (48%). 
Additionally, group travellers enjoyed the convenience of having pre-planned itineraries and 
organized transportation (38%). 
 
(4) 
Interestingly, both groups had similar levels of interest in exploring new cultures and trying new 
experiences (40% for solo travellers, 36% for group travellers). Similarly, both groups valued the 
opportunity to relax and escape from the stresses of everyday life (36% for solo travellers, 32% for 
group travellers). 
(5) However, there were also some notable differences between the two groups. For example, solo 
travellers placed a higher priority on budget-friendly travel options (38%) compared to group 
travellers (24%). Conversely, group travellers were more likely to prioritize luxury and comfort during 
their travels (28%) compared to solo travellers (12%). 
(6) 
 
Overall, the survey results suggest that both group and solo travel have their own unique advantages 
and appeal to different individuals, based on their preferences and priorities.

Antarctic ice sheet melt entirely? Will the Gulf Stream ocean current be disrupted? Will it be the end

debate — not just because it’s the only place in the world, which has never sustained a human 
population and therefore remains relatively ‘pristine’ in this respect; but more importantly, because 
it holds in its ice-cores half-million-year-old carbon records trapped in its layers of ice.

foretold that one day the Tiger King would actually have to die.  
“The child will grow up to become the warrior of warriors, hero of heroes, champion of champions. 
But...” they bit their lips and swallowed hard. When compelled to continue, the astrologers came out
