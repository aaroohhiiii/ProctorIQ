  SECTION A : READING SKILLS (22 marks) 
1. Literary passage 12m  
i B. It serves as the ship's computer 
[It is mentioned in the text that the white lab mouse in the control room of the Heart of 
Gold spaceship is the ship's computer.]

No partial credit 
ii C. Loss and change  
[Destruction of his home planet = loss and the introduction of new technologies = change]

No partial credit 
iii Descriptive  
"In the center of the room was a large console covered in buttons and 
switches, and in the middle of the console was a small, white mouse."  
[This description provides a clear image of the setting and the unconventional form of the 
ship's computer.] 
 
Humorous  
"Oh, not again," groaned Ford.  
[This line is humorous because it suggests that the ship's computer, Eddie, frequently offers 
to sing songs and annoy the crew. Ford's reaction of groaning implies that this is a common 
occurrence and that he's tired of it. The humour comes from the fact that a computer is 
attempting to sing a song, which is an unexpected and absurd situation.]

vi The name "The Paranoid Android" is ironic because-  
▪ it is unexpected for a robot to exhibit human-like emotions such as 
paranoia.  
▪ robots are often thought of as logical and unemotional, whereas the 
name "paranoid" implies irrational fear and anxiety.  
▪ it plays with readers' expectations and stereotypes of robots.

Q - No ½ credit  
vii The comparison is with cobblers, who take scraps of leather and stitch them 
together to create a shoe, in the same way in which the body of Marvin was 
put together or ‘cobbled’, using spare parts. [The word "cobbled" here, implies a 
sense of roughness and unevenness, as if the body has been put together in a haphazard 
manner. It also suggests that the body is assembled together, rather than being a cohesive 
whole.]

No partial credit 
viii The statement by Marvin, despite being an android, humanizes the character 
by evoking a sense of loneliness and isolation that is relatable to the reader.  
It also emphasizes the theme of the alienation and lack of communication 
between beings in the vastness of space.

interpretation 
and explanation

This creates a sense of sympathy towards Marvin and also raises questions 
about the meaning and value of existence, regardless of whether one is 
organic or synthetic. -Partial credit 1

addressing the 
Q - No ½ credit 
ix B. (b) (c) and (d) 
[(a) accurate -represents the main focus of the excerpt: Marvin, a depressed and paranoid 
android who precedes humanity; (b) incorrect- downplaying serious implications and though 
the passage does contain humorous elements, it also deals with weighty topics such as the 
destruction of Earth and the search for a new home; (c) incorrect- no mention of aliens ; (d) 
incorrect- there is no mention of time travel in the excerpt. The technologies mentioned, 
such as the Heart of Gold spaceship and the Infinite Improbability Drive, are related to time 
travel; (e) correct-  there is mention of a new technology, the Infinite Improbability Drive, 
that allowed for Arthur’s quick travel across galaxies in a spaceship]

SECTION C : LITERATURE TEXTBOOK AND SUPPLEMENTARY READING TEXT  (40 marks) 
     7 Poetry  
No partial credit of ½ , unless indicated. 
A) i C. The immortality of art and literature.  
[The extract emphasizes the idea that the tales of the mighty dead are an "endless fountain 
of immortal drink" that pour down to us from the heavens, suggesting that these stories and 
legends are timeless and will never truly die. This theme speaks to the enduring power of art 
and literature to transcend time and space and to continue to inspire and move people long 
after their creators have passed away.] 
1 
ii FALSE 
[The dead are referred to as "mighty" in the poem because they have achieved greatness in 
their lifetime. They may have contributed to society in a significant way or achieved great 
things in their respective fields. It is not about the power they exerted on the people. By 
referring to them as "mighty," the poet emphasizes their importance and the positive impact 
or influence they have had on the world.] 
1 
iii ...just as a fountain constantly pours forth water, the tales of the mighty dead 
pour forth endless inspiration and wisdom for the living.  
[The term "immortal drink" suggests that the stories are never-ending and that they have 
the power to nourish and sustain us in much the same way that water does.] 
1 
 
iv abundance 
[ The use of the word "brink" in the poem suggests that the immortality that is being poured 
onto us is on the verge of overflowing. This powerful image suggests that the beauty and 
grandeur of the dooms are so great that they are overflowing from heaven. This image of 
1 
Page 7 of 14 
 
abundance reinforces the idea that the beauty and grandeur of the dooms are endless and 
that there is an infinite supply of it.] 
v tombs [rhymes with dooms , which is the last word of line 1] 
     
1 
vi D. Creates a sense of anticipation and expectation for the reader 
[ the lack of punctuation at the end of the first line has a subtle yet significant impact on the 
poem, creating a sense of flow and continuity while also building anticipation and engaging 
the reader's imagination.] 
1 
 
B) i D. Fearful and apprehensive 
[The speaker mentions feeling an "old familiar ache" and "childhood's fear" when looking at 
her mother. This suggests a sense of fear or apprehension that is rooted in the speaker's past 
experiences with her mother.] 
1 
ii It suggests a contrast between the speaker's internal emotional response and 
her outward behaviour. 
1 
iii B. sensitivity  
iv FALSE [the poem’s line  holds a simile/metaphor whereas the other line is an example of 
alliteration - w sound] 
1 
v The poem highlights the importance of cherishing and appreciating the 
people we love,  while we still can. [quality time -life is transient and similar] 
1 
vi ...the speaker is trying to hold back her emotions and remain composed, 
despite the pain she feels at parting from her mother 
 
8 Prose-Vistas 
No partial credit of ½ , unless indicated. 
A) i This makes it an important reference point for understanding the effects of 
human activities on the environment and the potential impacts of climate 
change.[The absence of a human population in Antarctica means that the region is 
relatively pristine and has not been subject to the same levels of human impact as other 
areas of the world.] 
1 
ii C. are differing views on the causes and implications of climate change 1 
iii ... just like a time machine would allow us to observe past events, carbon 
records allow us to observe past climate conditions. 
[ Carbon records allow us to study past climates by analysing the air bubbles trapped in ice 
cores. They provide a glimpse into the Earth's atmospheric conditions at the time the ice was 
formed and can help scientists understand how the climate has changed over time.] 
1 
iv (Any one) 
▪ ...because the writer presents information in a straightforward and 
objective manner 
▪ ...because the writer applies a third-person point of view and avoids the 
use of personal opinion or emotional language 
▪   ...because the writer uses a logical structure to present their argument 
(starting with the importance of Antarctica as a relatively pristine location, and then 
moving on to explain the significance of the ice cores and carbon records found there) 
1 
B) i (Any one) 
▪ create a sense of approaching doom  
▪ use it as a tool to heighten the reader's curiosity and interest in the 
story 
1 
ii D. Unease  
[The use of this physical gesture indicates a sense of discomfort or unease, and implies that 
the astrologers were reluctant to reveal the prophecy. Humiliation or grief would be more 
1 
Page 8 of 14 
 
strongly expressed in the text if they were the emotions being conveyed. Disbelief is also not 
the correct answer, as there is no indication that the astrologers doubted their prediction.] 
iii bravery/ heroism / leadership 
[The astrologers are predicting that the child born under this star will be a great warrior and 
a champion, implying that the child will display exceptional courage and bravery in battle or 
in other challenges. This also suggests that the child will be a leader and will inspire others 
with their bravery and heroism. The use of these superlative phrases further emphasizes the 
astrologers' admiration for this trait and the importance they place on it in predicting the 
child's future.] 
1 
iv This is so because the word "fantastic" is usually associated with something 
positive or exciting, while the word "demise" suggests something negative or 
tragic.  
[In this context, the use of "fantastic" to describe the Tiger King's death creates a contrast 
between the positive connotation of the word and the negative reality of the situation] 
1 
9 Prose -Flamingo 
No partial credit of ½ , unless indicated. 
A) i (Any two) 
▪ the sounds of the opening and closing of desks 
▪ the loud lessons repeated in unison 
▪ the teacher's ruler rapping on the table 
 
1 
ii A. The classmates have started the lesson.  
[The protagonist sees through the window that the other students are already in their places, 
and this makes him feel anxious as he is trying to avoid being seen and is worried about being 
scolded by the teacher and embarrassed in front of his classmates. The fact that the other 
students have already started the lesson adds to his anxiety.] 
1 
iii ...the school was unusually quiet and still, as if it were a day of rest / holiday/ 
school off,  rather than a bustling school day 
1 
iv The protagonist seems to have a plan for how to sneak into class without 
being noticed, suggesting that they may have been in similar situations 
before. [The protagonist states: "I had counted on the commotion to get to my desk 
without being seen," which implies that they have been late before and have developed a 
strategy for avoiding punishment.] 
1 
v The strictness and severity of M. Hamel's discipline 
 
1 
vi B. The Importance of Punctuality 
[The extract revolves around the theme of punctuality and the consequences of being late. 
The protagonist is anxious and embarrassed about being late to school, highlighting the 
importance of being on time. The other options, such as A) The Fears of a Latecomer, C) The 
Rigidity of the School System, and D) The Anxiety of a Young Student, touch upon some of 
the themes in the extract but do not fully capture the central idea.] 
1 
B) i (Any one) 
▪ To give voice to their hopes, dreams, and struggles in a way that is 
immediate and relatable 
▪ To add a sense of authenticity and realism to the story 
▪ To make the experience more engaging and memorable for the reader 
1 
ii B. An opinion. 
[The line "It is not lack of money but a tradition to stay barefoot" is an opinion, since it is a 
subjective interpretation of the cultural practice of walking barefoot. The author is 
expressing her belief (“explanation”), in this extract] 
1 
iii ▪ (Any one) 1 
Page 9 of 14 
 
▪ The boys are barefoot, which suggests that they may come from poor or 
marginalized backgrounds and do not have access to proper footwear. 
▪ The phrase "an army of barefoot boys" implies that the boys are a 
unified group, and that they have a sense of solidarity or shared identity. 
▪ The comparison to "morning birds" suggests that the boys are lively and 
energetic, and that they move around quickly and unpredictably. 
▪ The fact that the boys "disappear at noon" suggests that their time is 
limited or constrained in some way, and that they may need to return to 
their homes or other responsibilities. 
▪ The use of the word "disappear" may also imply that the boys are 
overlooked or ignored by the wider society, and that they are not given 
the recognition or support that they need. 
▪ The phrase "like the morning birds" could also imply that the boys are 
vulnerable, and that their carefree lifestyle may be disrupted by external 
factors such as poverty, exploitation, or violence. 
 
(explanation 
needed via 
reference to the 
line) 
iv The line from the text: "Over the months, I have come to recognize each of 
them."  
[This suggests that the writer has been observing and interacting with the boys for a 
prolonged period of time, and that she has developed a deeper understanding of their lives 
and circumstances. The phrase "over the months" indicates that the writer's relationship 
with the boys is ongoing and has developed gradually, rather than being a one-time 
encounter.] 
1 
v C. "I like your shoes. What matters is that they protect your feet." 
[The reason for this is that the writer's comment had been met with silence and the shuffling 
of feet by the boy, which suggests that he may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable about his 
footwear. Therefore, a comment that emphasizes the functional purpose of shoes and 
acknowledges their value in protecting one's feet would likely be more reassuring and 
positive. 
Option A ("Why are your shoes mismatched? That's not a good look.") could be seen as 
critical and potentially judgmental, and may not be well-received by the boy. 
Option B ("Don't worry about your shoes, you can wear a matching pair later.") may not be 
practical or realistic, depending on the boy's circumstances. 
Option D ("Have you chosen to mismatch your shoes?") may come across as sarcastic or 
dismissive, and may not effectively address the boy's feelings or needs.] 
1 
vi straightforward / uncomplicated / direct/ clear  
The boy's simple answer implies that there may not be any hidden or complex reasons for 
his lack of footwear, and that the explanation for why he wasn't wearing chappals was as 
straightforward as his mother not bringing them down from the shelf. The use of the word 
"simply" in this context emphasizes the directness and clarity of the boy's response, and 
suggests that he may not have felt the need to elaborate or justify his situation further.]

The given detailed reference points can be drawn upon to structure the desired response: 
i ▪ that Gandhi's commitment to the cause of the peasants, despite being a stranger to the 
region, was exemplary and motivated the lawyers to continue their support 
▪ highlights the idea that the lawyers were conscious of the potential shame they would 
bring upon themselves if they deserted the peasants in their time of need 
▪ suggests that Gandhi's moral authority and courage had a significant impact on those 
around him and helped to inspire a sense of purpose and conviction in their own efforts 
to fight for justice and freedom. 
ii If more informative than sensory, the impact on the reader would likely be less emotional 
and engaging as : 
▪ sensory details help readers connect with the experience being described on a deeper 
level.  
▪ sensory details allow readers to visualize the scene in their minds and feel like they are 
a part of it.  
Even though informative details may provide more factual information but can sometimes 
feel detached and impersonal, leaving readers feeling less connected to the story.  
iii Serves as a significant backdrop for the events that unfold in the story.  
▪ creates a sense of isolation and desolation, emphasizing the loneliness and despair that 
the peddler experiences  
▪ the harsh winter conditions and the barren landscape add to the overall tone of 
melancholy and hopelessness 
▪ the forest also represents the metaphorical wilderness of the human soul, highlighting 
the struggles and temptations that people face in their journey through life  
Therefore, the setting plays a vital role in establishing the mood and atmosphere of the 
story. 
iv ▪ If the last four lines were omitted, the poem would have a more sombre tone.  
▪ Without the image of the tigers continuing to prance, the poem would end on a note of 
despair, with Aunt Jennifer's hands still ringed with the ordeals she was mastered by.  
▪ The message of the poem would refer to the oppression and suffering of women, 
without any hope for liberation. 
[By ending the poem on these lines, the author achieves a sense of hope and transcendence. The image of the 
tigers continuing to prance, proud and unafraid, suggests that there is a way to transcend the oppression and 
suffering of women, even if it is only through art. The poet suggests that art can provide a kind of liberation, 
even in the face of social and cultural constraints.] 
v Umberto Eco suggests that the success of his book, "The Name of the Rose," was largely 
due to timing. He believes that if he had written the book ten years earlier or ten years 
later, it wouldn't have had the same impact.  
▪ This could be interpreted as Eco recognizing the importance of cultural context and 
how the reception of a work of art is influenced by the historical, social, and political 
climate of its time.  
▪ Eco might be suggesting that the themes and ideas he explored in his novel resonated 
particularly strongly with readers in the cultural moment in which it was published, and 
that this moment was fleeting.  
Therefore, if he had written the book earlier or later, it might not have been as relevant or 
timely, and might not have captured the same level of attention and interest. 
vi Subbu's success in the film industry reveals that loyalty, creativity, and versatility are essential 
qualities for success in this field - 
Page 11 of 14 
 
▪ Subbu was an extremely loyal employee who identified himself completely with his 
principal and turned his entire creativity to his principal's advantage.  
▪ He was also a highly versatile and creative person who could be inspired to come up with 
numerous alternatives when given a problem to solve.  
▪ Additionally, he had the ability to work well with others and was tailor-made for the film 
industry.  
These qualities made him an invaluable asset to the Gemini Studios during its golden years. 
11 Answer any TWO of three following questions in 40-50 words each.                        (2x2=4) 
Content -1  
→ Full credit for appropriate inclusion of all content asked for 
→ Partial credit  ½ for relevant but incomplete content 
 
Expression – 1 
→ Full credit for effective organisation 
→ Partial credit  ½ for some semblance of organisation of ideas 
 
Deduct ½ mark from the overall score if the error density is high (more than a total of 2 spellings and/or 
grammatical errors).  
 
The given detailed reference points can be drawn upon to structure the desired response. 
i ▪ At the time of the incident, the writer was only in the third grade, which means that she 
was likely around eight years old - children at that age are still developing their cognitive 
and emotional abilities - it is not uncommon for them to lack a full understanding of 
complex social issues like untouchability 
▪ The writer's shared that she had not, till then, heard people speak openly of untouchability -  suggests that she may not have had a complete grasp of the issue's societal 
implications.  
▪ It is possible that she understood that certain individuals were treated differently from 
others, but she may not have fully comprehended the scope of the problem 
ii The play highlights the damaging effects of prejudice and stereotypes on both the victim and 
the perpetrator. However, it also suggests that empathy and understanding can overcome 
these barriers.  
Through the development of a relationship between the two characters, Derry and Mr. Lamb, 
we see how their initial assumptions about each other are challenged and ultimately broken 
down.  
This underscores the importance of empathy in recognizing and overcoming prejudices, as it 
allows individuals to see beyond surface-level differences and connect on a deeper level. 
iii ▪ In the given lines, Hana is expressing her frustration with Yumi, who is hesitant to help her 
with the wounded white man.  
▪ By saying "Is this anything but a man? And a wounded helpless man!" Hana is highlighting 
the fact that they are all humans, regardless of their race or nationality.  
▪ She believes that their common humanity makes it their moral duty to help the wounded 
man.  
▪ In these lines, she is asserting her own intervention and belief in the importance of doing 
the right thing, even if it goes against traditional values or societal norms.  
▪ This demonstrates her sense of moral superiority over Yumi, who is more concerned with 
following the strict rules of her society than with helping a fellow human being.

A. Suggested response : 
 
Dear Robert 
I recently read your poem, "A Roadside Stand," and was struck by the conflicting emotions 
that you expressed towards the end. I understand that it can be difficult to make decisions 
when we are overwhelmed by our emotions. 
 
In my own experience, I have found that taking a moment of stillness and reflection can be 
very helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the situation and connecting with our own 
humanity and that of others. This is the message that I try to convey in my poem, "Keeping 
Quiet." 
 
I would advise you to take a moment to be still and contemplative before making any 
decisions about the fate of the people at the roadside stand. By quieting your mind and being 
present in the moment, you may be able to understand their struggles and pain objectively, 
and gain a new perspective about your own place in the world too. I also feel that by breaking 
from your routine and taking a moment of stillness and reflection, you might gain a deeper 
understanding of the situation and make a more functional decision. 
 
I believe that this moment of reflection could help you to see beyond your conflicting 
emotions. We are all human, after all, and before connecting with others, and resolving their 
issues, we must try to connect with our own selves to advice from a place of balance and 
calm. 
 
I hope this advice is helpful to you. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to 
support you.

Good morning, everyone. 
As I analysed the allotted texts , I noticed that though each portrayal of women was unique, 
they all offered varied insights into the experiences of women in society.  
 
To begin with, Aunt Jennifer was portrayed as a victim of patriarchy, living in a world where 
women were expected to conform to societal norms and expectations and was unable to 
attain freedom and strength she desired, due to the limitations imposed upon her by society. 
Page 13 of 14 
 
In contrast, Sophie was portrayed as ambitious and determined to break free from societal 
norms. She refused to be limited by her gender and sought to challenge the restrictions 
placed upon her. Sophie's mother, on the other hand, from a generation prior, had chosen to 
conform and sacrifice her individuality to societal expectations. 
 
 
Similarly in "Lost Spring," the grandmother and daughter-in-law, in Firozabad, were portrayed 
as resilient in the face of poverty and the societal constraints of their caste. However, unlike 
Sophie’s and Aunt Jennifer’s need to find an outlet, they found ways to make the best of their 
situation, despite the limitations placed upon them.  
When we analyse the portrayal of the aged mother, in "My Mother at Sixty-six,", she is 
presented as vulnerable and in need of protection. Sadly, it does make one wonder about the 
unaddressed vulnerability of Sophie’s mother and the grandmother in “Lost Spring”. A point 
worth considering is that Kamala Das’ mother’s acceptance of her circumstances comes 
across as a voluntary decision, whereas that of the women in “Lost Spring” is a akin to 
resignation.  
These portrayals of women offer valuable insights into the experiences of women in our 
society -from victimization to the resilience in the face of poverty - and offer us important 
lessons about strength, vulnerability, and the need for empathy and respect.  
To conclude, I’d like to say that as readers, we can learn from their experiences and strive 
towards a more equitable and just society.  These characters, stress that it is important to 
recognise the complexities of each woman’s experiences, and refrain from passing sweeping 
judgements as women are not a uniform group, but rather unique individuals.

A Suggested response : 
 
I have been married to Charley for a few years now and I have always known him to be an 
intelligent man with an imaginative mind. However, his recent obsession with finding the 
Third Level has left me quite worried. While he talks about it with excitement, I cannot help 
but wonder if it is a good quality or a harmful one. 
 
On one hand, Charley’s obsession displays his determination and persistence in achieving his 
goals. It shows that he is willing to go to great lengths to unravel the mysteries of life. His 
imagination and curiosity are admirable qualities that have always attracted me to him.

However, his obsession has caused him to become detached from reality. He is no longer able 
to differentiate between what is real and what is not. He spends all his time and money 
searching for a place that may not even exist. This could be harmful not only to himself but 
also to our family. 
 
I understand that he feels overwhelmed by the stress and pressures of his present life and Sam 
indicated that he uses his obsession as a coping mechanism. I think this is harmful as it 
prevents him from addressing the underlying issues that are causing him stress.  
 
Furthermore, Charley’s obsession has caused him to neglect his responsibilities. He has been 
absent from work and has not been able to contribute financially to our household. His 
obsession is affecting our relationship, and I am afraid that if he continues on this path, it 
might lead to irreparable damage. 
 
Finally, all I can say is , I believe that Charley’s obsession with finding the Third Level may have 
started as a harmless curiosity, but it has now become a harmful one. I love him dearly and I 
hope that he realizes that his obsession is affecting not only himself but also those around 
him.

I find myself reflecting on an event that happened many years ago, one that has continued to 
haunt me ever since. It is the incident where my long hair was forcefully cut off at the Carlisle 
Indian School. As I sit here today, I cannot help but feel conflicted about my actions that day. 
 
On one hand, I am proud that I stood up for myself and refused to submit to their demands 
at first. I remember the fire in my belly as I declared that I would struggle before giving in. 
However, as time passed, my spirit wavered, and eventually, I allowed them to cut my hair. 
Looking back now, I cannot help but feel that I gave in too easily, that I did not do enough to 
resist. 
 
As I ponder over what I could have done differently, I realize that there might have been other 
options. Perhaps I could have sought help from my fellow students. Maybe I could have tried 
to escape or find another way out of the situation. But in that moment, I was so overwhelmed 
and confused that I could not think straight. 
 
I know that I have blamed myself for this incident for far too long. But today, I choose to 
absolve myself of any blame. As a young girl, I forced into a strange place. I was not given the 
chance to make my own choices, to decide what was best for me. I was a victim of a system 
that sought to strip away my identity and forced me to assimilate. 
 
Today, I choose to forgive myself and honour the brave little girl who stood up for herself 
that day. I am grateful for her courage and strength, and I will continue to honour her memory 
by fighting for justice and equality for all.
