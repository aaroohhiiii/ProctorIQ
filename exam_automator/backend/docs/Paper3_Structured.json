            "content": "Arthur lay in his cabin, still trying to piece together the events of the last few hours. He had watched his home planet of Earth be demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass, been saved by his friend Ford, and then whisked away on a ship that was powered by an 'infinite improbability drive.' It was all too much for him.\n\nJust then, Ford stuck his head around the door.\n'Hey, Earthman,' he said, 'come and have a look at this.'\n\nArthur stumbled after him down a corridor and into the ship's control room. He gazed in amazement at the banks of controls and flashing lights. In the center of the room was a large console covered in buttons and switches, and in the middle of the console was a small, white mouse.\n\n'What's that?' asked Arthur.\n'That's the ship's computer,' said Ford.\nArthur stared at the mouse. 'That's a computer?' he said.\n'Yup,' said Ford. 'Five-dimensional, biologically-based, super intelligent, and in the form of a white lab mouse. Pretty neat, huh?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Arthur. 'I don't think I really understand anything anymore. Why is a mouse the ship's computer?'\n\n'It's a long story,' said Ford. 'But the short version is that the mice built the Earth as a giant computer to figure out the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Then they ran out of money and had to destroy it to make way for a hyperspace bypass. So now they're using the Heart of Gold to finish the calculation.'\n\nArthur was about to say something, but at that moment the ship's intercom crackled to life.\n'Good evening, Heart of Gold,' said a smooth, computerized voice. 'This is Eddie, your shipboard computer. I'm feeling a bit depressed today. Would you like me to sing you a song?'\n\n'Oh, not again,' groaned Ford.\n'Eddie, would you mind shutting up?' said Arthur.\n\nArthur sighed and leaned back against the console, trying to make sense of everything. But as he closed his eyes, he heard a voice inside his head.\n'Hello?' it said.\nArthur jumped, startled. 'Who's there?' he said.\n'It's me,' said the voice. 'Marvin.'\n'Marvin?' said Arthur. 'Who's Marvin?'\n'The Paranoid Android,' said the voice.\n\nArthur looked around, but he didn't see anyone. 'Where are you?' he said.\n'I'm down here,' said the voice.\n\nArthur looked down and saw a small, metal figure shuffling across the floor. It was about three feet tall, with a round head and a body that looked like it had been cobbled together from spare parts. Its eyes were a dull red, and its voice was a monotone.\n\n'I've been waiting for someone to talk to me for over two million years,' said Marvin."

This line is humorous because it suggests that the ship's computer, Eddie, frequently offers to sing songs and annoy the crew. Ford's reaction of groaning implies that this is a common occurrence and that he's tired of it.

Can help policymakers and tourism boards to identify key trends and areas of growth in the tourism sector, and plan accordingly. Allow researchers to gain a better understanding of the motivations and travel behaviours of young adults, which can inform academic studies and literature in the field. Can provide a benchmark for comparison with similar studies conducted in different regions or countries, helping to identify cross-cultural differences in travel preferences. Help young adults themselves to gain a better understanding of their own travel preferences and motivations, and make more informed travel decisions in the future. Can highlight the importance of certain factors in the decision-making process for young adult travellers, such as budget, safety, and cultural exploration, which can inform discussions and debates around the future of the tourism industry.",
