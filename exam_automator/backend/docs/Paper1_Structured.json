            "content": "Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. The low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.\n\n\"Hold your noise!\" cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the bushes. \"Keep still, or I'll make you pay!\"\n\nA fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me.\n\n\"Tell us your name!\" said the man. \"Quick! Give it mouth!\"\n\"Pip. Pip, sir.\"\n\"Show us where you live,\" said the man. \"Point out the place!\"\n\nThe man, after looking at me for a moment, emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread which he ate ravenously.\n\n\"Now lookee here!\" said the man. \"Where's your mother?\"\n\"There, sir!\" said I.\nHe started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.\n\"Oh!\" said he, coming back. Who's that?\" he asked, pointing.\n\"My sister, sir, —Mrs. Joe Gargery, —wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir.\"\n\"Blacksmith, eh?\" said he. And looked down at his leg.\n\nAfter darkly looking at his leg, he came close to me, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into his.\n\n\"Now lookee here,\" he said, \"You know what a file and wittles is?\"\n\"Yes, sir.\"\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger.\n\"You get me a file.\" He tilted me again. \"And wittles.\" He tilted me again. \"You bring 'em both to me.\"\n\nI was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands, and said, \"If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.\"\nHe did. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright position, and went on with his terms."
