Subject: Need for early assessment of sports talent

Dear Sir,

Through your esteemed newspaper, I want to highlight the importance of identifying sports talent at a young age. Sports teachers and coaches should actively look for natural abilities in students during their formative years.

Early identification helps in building foundational skills that are crucial for long-term success. When children are trained from a young age, they develop discipline, teamwork, and sportsmanship. This creates a larger pool of skilled athletes for our country's future.

Building a strong sports culture will bring national pride and recognition. I hope the concerned authorities will take necessary steps in this direction.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Pranab Chauhan
