5. Letter to Editor (5 marks)
Option A: Sports talent assessment

Dear Editor,

I am writing to you about sports in schools. I think sports teachers should find good students who are good at sports. This is important because India needs good players.

Many children play sports but nobody sees their talent. Sports teachers should watch them and help them. This will make more athletes for India.

We need to start early so children can practice more and become better. Sports is good for health and also for the country.

Please publish this letter so people know about this problem.

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Pranab Chauhan

DIGITAL COMMUNICATION IN EDUCATION
By Nooran Sheikh

These days schools use computers and internet for teaching. This is very good because students can learn from home also. Teachers can send lessons online and students can watch them.

Computers make learning fun because there are videos and games. Students like this more than old books. Now education is available to everyone even in villages because of internet.

Teachers and students both benefit from this. Students can ask questions anytime and teachers can answer. This makes learning better.
