  II …that the sea is a wild, untamed, and menacing force / contribute to the ominous 
atmosphere of the scene / amplifying the sense of danger that Pip feels 
 
1
 
  III 
 
D) Pip’s knowledge of the surrounding area  
 
[ a) speaks of a scene in a place that feels cold, oppressive, and dangerous, which 
heightens Pip's sense of fear and helplessness. b) creates a feeling of menace due to 
the man’s appearance, reinforcing Pip's fear and powerlessness in the situation. c) 
shows his terror and helplessness.  d) is the Key because it refers to qualities that would 
imply Pip is capable and confident, which contradicts the idea of vulnerability.] 
 
1 
  IV 
 
B) threat    
 
[caution would be advice; prediction would involve stating what will happen in the future 
and an announcement would be a formal declaration. The Key is b) ‘threat’ as it directly 
communicates a potential consequence of harm or punishment.]

(Any one) 
 Being soaked in water and smothered in mud, which are physical conditions 
that typically cause discomfort) 
 Limping, which indicates possible injury or physical strain, contributing to 
discomfort. 
 Shivering and teeth chattering, which suggests cold or nervousness, both of 
which are associated with discomfort. 
 
  1 
VI 
 
C) Answer the question 
 
[The phrase is not specifically asking for increased volume or referring to a physical 
action like opening the mouth. The phrase is urging Pip to give a verbal response.]

VII It suggests that the man was extremely hungry. 
 
     1 
VIII 
 
It suggests that he is trying to gather information about Pip’s family. When he asks 
about Pip’s mother and looks over his shoulder, it shows he is possibly evaluating his 
surroundings or considering where Pip’s family might be, perhaps to assess if anyone 
is around to stop him and contemplating the best way to proceed without interference. 
1     2 
IX It increases the tension by emphasising the power dynamic between them. Pip is 
physically tilted backward, which makes him feel small and defenseless. This action 
not only makes Pip vulnerable but also intensifies the fear he feels. The man’s control 
over Pip’s position enhances the sense of intimidation, creating a more fearful and 
uneasy atmosphere in the scene. 
  2 
X A) Pip's encounter with a frightening man who demands information 
 
[a) directly addresses the core of the scene, where the man’s aggressive behavior and 
questioning of Pip create tension and fear. b), though relevant to the setting, is more of 
a background detail than the main focus. c) could have been possible, but it is more of 
an internal reaction of Pip rather than the central idea of the extract. d), doesn’t capture 
the primary conflict of the scene and the family context is just briefly mentioned.]

For the Visually Impaired Candidates 
 A) They allow individuals to independently make decisions and innovate.    1 
V A corporate job is better suited for Riya because it provides financial stability through 
a steady salary and offers structured career paths with clear opportunities for growth. 
Start-ups, on the other hand, often involve higher risks, irregular income, and less 
defined progression, which may not align with her preference for stability and 
predictability.

V C)  Overwhelmed by a sense of anguish 
 
1 
VI    B) The poet makes exclusive use of melancholic imagery in the given lines. 
 
[a) True: The ‘ashen face’ compared to a ‘corpse’ suggests the speaker’s fear of 
mortality and loss. b) False: While melancholic imagery (‘ashen face’ etc.) is present, 
the poet also uses vibrant imagery (‘young trees sprinting’ and ‘merry children 
spilling’) to create a contrast. Thus, melancholic imagery is not used exclusively. c) 
True: The internal conflict of hiding her sadness resonates deeply with human 
relationships. d) True: Universal themes such as aging, mortality, and the passage of 
time make the extract relatable to readers.]

II  …the enduring power of Aunt Jennifer’s creative spirit, even after her death

III  The tigers in the panel are bold, fearless, and free, symbolising strength, courage, 
and confidence. In contrast, Aunt's life is marked by fear, struggle, and oppression, 
which prevents her from living with the same power and freedom that her tigers 
represent.

V  C) A child playing freely in a park, unburdened by responsibilities. 
 
1 
VI  B) Art is a timeless expression that outlives its creator, continuing to embody their 
spirit and desires.      
[a) is correct because the poet prevails upon the enduring nature of art in this line, as 
the tigers, symbolising fearlessness and freedom, will persist even after Aunt Jennifer’s 
death. This highlights how art immortalises the creator’s emotions, aspirations, and 
essence, transcending the limitations and constraints of their mortal life. Option b) - d) 
incorrectly focus on the transience of art or misinterpret the tigers' symbolism.]

A.    
I Charley’s indifference to the cost of old-style bills and his focus on the cheap price of 
eggs in 1894 shows that he values the simplicity and affordability of the past, where 
things were less expensive and more relaxed.

III  The irony lies in the fact that Louisa initially worries and urges Charley to stop searching 
for the third level, but later, both of them end up looking for it together every weekend.  
 
[Her initial worry about Charley’s obsession with the third level contrasts with her 
eventual participation in the same quest, which creates an ironic shift in her behaviour]

I Mr. Lamb means that Derry’s appearance is not his whole identity. He sees 
beyond the scarred face to the person within and wants Derry to understand that 
he is more than what people see on the surface. 
1 
II  Correct option: c) "Maybe he really sees more than just my face." 
The pause suggests Derry is processing Mr. Lamb’s words, possibly 
reconsidering his belief that no one sees beyond his disfigurement. 
1 
III 
 
Mr. Lamb’s response suggests that he sees Derry’s face as only one aspect of 
who he is. 
1 
IV  The exchange reveals that Derry feels deeply misunderstood and defined by his 
appearance, while Mr. Lamb tries to connect with him on a human level by challenging 
Derry’s belief that no one can see beyond his scar.

[b) is correct because Edla’s entire demeanor toward the rattrap peddler is built on 
kindness (2) and she does not look down on him despite his being a vagabond, treating 
him with respect (4). Her tone is formal not casual / excited (5) , doesn’t offer money(3) 
and there is no evidence of any compliment paid (1) hence a) , c) and d) are incorrect.]

D) He recognised and appreciated her compassion.  
 
(This shows genuine appreciation and trust, not just politeness or obligation. His 
willingness to go with her and accept the fur coat without resistance indicates that he 
feels seen and valued—something he likely hasn’t experienced in a long time.) (a) 
implies insincerity, which isn't supported by the extract ; (b) The extract doesn’t suggest 
obligation; his response feels voluntary. (c) There is no sign of doubt or suspicion in 
his words or actions at that moment. 
1 
IV  Because the peddler, a poor vagabond in rags, was treated with respect and generosity 
by Edla, which was an unusual gesture of kindness for someone of his status. 
 
1 
V  Because his thoughts explicitly reveal regret and anxiety about stealing the ‘fellow’s’ 
money / show that his guilt over the theft is weighing heavily on him This self
awareness and fear of being caught clearly stem from his guilt, making it the primary 
driver of his forebodings.

[ Option a) is correct because (1) aligns with the tone of resignation and wistfulness in 
the mother's sigh. (3) is a direct reflection of their financial hardships. The mother's sigh 
likely conveys her acceptance of the reality that money has always been scarce for 
their family. (5) mother's awareness of the impracticality of Sophie's grand dreams 
given their circumstances. 
(2) doesn’t fit as the context does not indicate the mother perceives Derek’s remark 
as ‘troubling Sophie.’ (4) suggests irritation or fatigue but mother’s sigh in this context 
appears more reflective of their financial struggles and her resignation ] 
 
1 
III  A) appearance vs. reality 
 
[The delicate bow on Sophie’s mother’s apron symbolises grace and beauty, whereas 
her crooked back represents the harsh realities of her life, such as physical toil and 
hardship.] 
 
1 
IV   Sophie felt a tightening in her throat. 
 
1 
V 
 
The writer emphasises the oppressive and suffocating environment of Sophie’s 
household. The heavy breathing of her father is not just a physical sound but a 
metaphorical representation of the overwhelming weight of fatigue, labour, and 
monotony that dominates their lives.  
 
[The word ‘cluttered’ conveys a sense of overcrowding and disorder, suggesting that 
even intangible elements like exhaustion and hardship fill and overwhelm the small, 
confined space of their home.] 
 
1 
VI  The setting of the room, which is cluttered and steamy from the stove, creates a sense 
of discomfort and hardship. This contributes to the mood of weariness and tension in 
the family’s daily life, which Sophie is acutely aware of.

I  The narrator's feelings towards the French language shift from indifference to deep 
appreciation and respect when it is no longer allowed to be taught. 
Also, French, in the story, symbolises the loss of freedom and the imposition of foreign 
control over the region. Therefore, the narrator’s sense of loss and regret reflects the 
emotional impact of this change. 
 
2 
II  Individuals can learn that fear can be overcome through perseverance, determination, 
and gradual exposure to the source of fear. Douglas’s experience teaches that facing 
challenges step by step, with proper guidance and practice, allows one to conquer even 
the most deep-seated fears, leading to personal growth and freedom.

III  Keats portrays beauty as something that ‘will never pass into nothingness,’ implying 
that, unlike fleeting material comforts, beauty offers lasting emotional and 
psychological support. In the real world, during times of hardship, turning to the 
enduring beauty of nature, art, or meaningful experiences can provide a sense of peace 
and restoration  
OR 
Just as Keats speaks of beauty creating a ‘bower quiet’ and offering ‘sweet dreams,’ 
recognising beauty in our surroundings or lives can act as a refuge from stress, offering 
perspective and a sense of tranquility.  
 
This connection with beauty can help shift focus from negativity and provide hope, 
strength, and a reminder that there is always something uplifting to turn to, even in the 
toughest times. 
 
2 
IV  The reference signifies a pause in exploitative and destructive human activities. It 
reflects the poet's call for introspection and awareness of the harm humans cause to 
nature and themselves. By pausing, the fishermen and the salt gatherer are shown 
as reconnecting with their humanity and reflecting on their actions. 
 
2 
V Kipling’s refusal highlights the invasion of privacy that often accompanies public life. 
The refusal shows that the value of an individual’s work or thoughts should not be 
reduced to a commercial or public spectacle. 
Kipling’s stance emphasises the discomfort and control that is often stripped away 
during the process of an interview. 
 
2 
VI  The narrator in Lost Spring adds depth and empathy, offering critical insights into 
Saheb and Mukesh’s struggles within systemic poverty. Unlike a plain narrative, the 
narrator reflects on social inequalities and privileges, making readers more emotionally 
engaged. Her observations contextualise the boys' lives within broader social issues, 
urging reflection and creating a more impactful critique of injustice.

I   Programmes like ‘Students on Ice’ provide hands-on experiences, allowing students 
to witness environmental changes firsthand. This immersive learning fosters a deeper 
understanding of geological shifts and the importance of addressing climate change, 
encouraging informed action and advocacy for the planet’s future. It also inspires a 
sense of responsibility in young people to actively contribute to sustainability and 
environmental conservation. 
 
2 
II   The comparison to a puppet suggests that she is being manipulated by external forces, 
unable to act according to her own will. This metaphor point towards her feelings of 
being dehumanised and treated like an object rather than a person with free will. It also 
reflects the broader theme of cultural displacement, as she is forced into an 
environment where her Native American identity is undermined, and she must comply 
with the rigid rules of the boarding school.

This remark reflects Derry’s frustration with the way people console others by 
comparing struggles. He feels such comparisons dismiss his pain, highlighting his 
sensitivity and resentment toward invalidating his personal experiences. It shows his 
2

desire to be understood for his individual challenges rather than being generalised or 
pitied.

A. 
While ‘Indigo’ delves into the economic and systemic oppression of sharecroppers by British 
landlords, ‘The Roadside Stand’ highlights the plight of rural people exploited by urban elites and 
a neglectful system. Both works emphasise the imbalance of power and the struggles of those at 
the bottom of the societal hierarchy. 
In ‘Indigo’, the exploitation of Champaran’s peasants is evident in the oppressive sharecropping 
system, where British landlords forced them to grow indigo on a portion of their land and unfairly 
profited from it. Similarly, ‘The Roadside Stand’ portrays a countryside inhabitant selling their goods 
by the roadside, hoping for a fair chance at economic survival. Their disappointment reflects the 
false promises of development, as urban buyers and authorities fail to address their needs, leaving 
them trapped in poverty. 
Both texts reveal a shared truth—exploitation persists when power dynamics remain unchecked, 
and progress often bypasses those who need it most. While Gandhi’s efforts in ‘Indigo’ offer a path 
of hope through resistance, Frost’s poem serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing neglect 
faced by rural communities. Together, they highlight the importance of empathy, equity, and 
advocacy in combating exploitation. 
 
B·   
 
In both ‘Poets and Pancakes’ and ‘Going Places’, the characters of the office boy and Sophie share 
common traits of ambition and dreams that surpass their immediate realities.  
 
The office boy, like Sophie, dreams of achieving something greater—he aspires to be a star actor, 
director, or writer, but is stuck in a subordinate role in the make-up department. Similarly, Sophie 
dreams of running a boutique or becoming an actress, yet is constrained by financial limitations 
and family’s expectations. Both characters, despite their seemingly humble positions, hold onto 
lofty dreams that offer them an escape from their current circumstances. 
 
However, while Sophie is often dismissive of the practicality of her ambitions, focusing instead on 
grand ideals, the office boy seems more realistic in his understanding of the obstacles he faces, 
despite his unfulfilled aspirations. 
 
Both characters represent dreams and ambitions constrained by their environments. While their 
pursuits are met with limitations, they reflect the universal desire to transcend one’s current 
situation and achieve something greater.

A·   
 
Sadao’s character arc in ‘The Enemy’ is central to the moral dilemma of the story. Initially, Sadao 
is deeply loyal to his country and driven by a sense of patriotism, yet he is a doctor sworn to 
10 
 
preserve life. When the American prisoner washes ashore, Sadao’s internal conflict emerges—
 should he help an enemy soldier, risking his own safety, or adhere to his nationalistic duty.  
As the story progresses, Sadao’s arc moves from hesitation and reluctant duty to genuine 
compassion for the soldier. He goes beyond his initial patriotic impulses, deciding to save the life 
of the wounded man, showing his internal growth and moral courage. His arc symbolises the 
triumph of humanity over nationalism, as he eventually values the life of an individual over 
political allegiances. 
In contrast, Hana’s transformation is subtler. While she starts with fear and repulsion, her 
compassion grows, but she does not undergo the same profound transformation as Sadao. Her 
evolution is more passive, as she supports her husband’s decision rather than leading it.  
Thus, Sadao’s arc is more central to the story’s moral conflict. 
 
B.  
 
The satirical tone is central to the narrative, as Kalki uses humour and irony to critique the Maharaja’s 
blind obsession with fulfilling a prophecy. Through exaggerated events, such as the Maharaja’s 
declaration to kill 100 tigers or the astrologer’s dramatic predictions, the narrative highlights the 
absurdity of human arrogance and misplaced priorities.  
The detached third-person omniscient narrator adds to this effect, providing sardonic commentary 
on the Maharaja’s actions, which invites readers to critically evaluate his decisions rather than 
empathise with him. 
The use of foreshadowing and dramatic irony keeps the reader engaged. The prophecy of the 100th 
tiger causing the Maharaja’s death looms over the narrative, creating anticipation and humour as 
the Maharaja ironically believes he can outwit fate.  
The ultimate twist, where a wooden tiger indirectly causes his death, adds a layer of poignant irony. 
Additionally, Kalki critiques human folly and power through the dialogues, hyperbole, and 
absurdities of the plot, leaving readers entertained yet reflective.
